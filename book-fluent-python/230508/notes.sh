# I'reading chapter 8 of the fluent python book
# it is about creating a vector class
# in this vector class we want to build an N dimensional vector
# which could hold the frequency that words appear in texts
# and this could be used to infer if two pieces of text are similar or not
# 
# we could implement the functionalities from this library using pure python
# or we could use numpy and scipy libraries
# and then we could compare them with Rust
